A field in which the user enters a URL. 

A field such as a menu or a spinner that allows the user to choose the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) .

A button that executes the task when the user touches it.  

A scrolling display of the source code of the web page. Use an 

AsyncTask to retrieve the source code of the web page.
